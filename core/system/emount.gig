# 1. one parameter i.e. /dev/sda1 will be cut and translated to sda1,
# 2. two parameters i.e. "/dev/sda1 ext" will be mounted in /mnt/ext
# 3. one parameter i.e. file orr /home/user/file will not get mounted
# 4. two parameters i.e. "file intfile" will get mounted into /mnt/intfile
# if mount directory does not exist, create
# if mount directory is in use, bail out
# root permissions are required to mount (i.e. sudo)
# mount will have user:user ownership after mounting
