# general bash additions and framework

This does 3 basic things:
* provide initial config for new/fresh systems
* provide functions and solutions to make everyday work easier
* be a framework for expanding abovementioned functionality

Most of the things that you are installing with ginger are optional.
Non-optional files are pure bash-only functions that should not
colide with any system configs or preexisting setups.

Duding the instalation you have the full controll on that you want
to install and what you want to skip. Additionally, installer will ask
you if there are conflicts and whenever you want to proceed.
